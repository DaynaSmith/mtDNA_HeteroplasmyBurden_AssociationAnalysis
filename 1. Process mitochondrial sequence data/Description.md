**These scripts perform the following tasks:**

_1. extract-per-sample-haplogroup-defining-sites.py_
Reads the haplogroups_extended.csv file generated by Haplogrep 3 and creates a list of haplogroup-defining variants for each individual. 

_2. ProcessVCFs.R_
Reads VCF and associated sample data, removes haplogroup-defining variants and classifies remaining variants into heteroplasmies and homoplasmies based on VAF. 

_3. DescriptiveStats.R_
Generates some basic graphs and statistics summarising the heteroplasmic data.
